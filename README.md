# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-system

 Developed an Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction system using machine learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model. 
 
 Performed data preprocessing, outlier removal, and sub-index AQI reconstruction using real-world CPCB pollutant data. 
 
 Achieved high accuracy (RÂ² > 0.95) and deployed the model via a Streamlit web app for real-time AQI forecasting based on pollutant input.
